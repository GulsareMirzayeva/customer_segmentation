# Customer Segmentation - EDA with Pandas 🧪

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project performed on a customer segmentation dataset using Pandas and Python.

## 📁 Contents

- `data/Segmentation.xlsx` — Raw dataset
- `notebooks/01_initial_analysis.ipynb` — Data cleaning and analysis notebook

## 🧹 Steps Performed

- Handled missing values using `mean` and `mode`
- Checked value distributions with `.value_counts()`
- Grouped and analyzed patterns using `.groupby()`
- Sorted, filtered and selected data for better understanding
- Analyzed categorical variables such as `Gender`, `Profession`, `Ever_Married`
- Created a clean version of `Spending_Score`

## 🚀 Future Work

- Visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Clustering and advanced segmentation
- Machine learning classification based on `Segmentation` labels

## 📌 Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for necessary libraries.
